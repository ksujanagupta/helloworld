# My First Git Repository

This repository contains my first ever project, a simple HTML file. It's a small learning project to get familiar with Git and GitHub.

## Project Description
This project is just a few lines HTML file that demonstrates super basic usage of HTML. It's part of my journey to learn version control with Git and manage projects on GitHub.
